# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Overview

This project explores the potential of survey questions from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to predict diabetes. It aims to identify the most predictive risk factors of diabetes and assess whether a subset or a short form of these questions can accurately predict diabetes risk.

## Research Questions

- Can BRFSS survey questions provide accurate predictions of whether an individual has diabetes?
- What risk factors are most predictive of diabetes?
- Can we use a subset of the risk factors to accurately predict diabetes?
- Is it possible to create a short form of questions from the BRFSS to predict diabetes or high diabetes risk effectively?

## Dataset Description

The dataset used is the 'diabetes_012_health_indicators_BRFSS2015' from Kaggle, containing various health indicators potentially related to diabetes, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, BMI, among others. The dataset includes both features and a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The project begins with a comprehensive EDA to understand the data's distribution, identify relationships, and spot anomalies. Key steps include:

- Preliminary exploration to understand the dataset's structure.
- Detailed analysis of individual features.
- Identification of patterns and relationships among the features.

### Model Development

- Selection of relevant features for predicting diabetes.
- Application of machine learning models to predict diabetes risk.
- Evaluation of model performance and selection of the best-performing model.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for model development and evaluation
